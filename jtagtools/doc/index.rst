PyJtagTools
===========

Overview
--------

PyJtagTools implements a JTAG TAP controller client.

It has been extracted from `PyFtdi <https://github.com/eblot/pyftdi>`_ v0.60, as its core features
are not specific to `PyFtdi <https://github.com/eblot/pyftdi>`_, and enable to support other JTAG
backend, for example the Remote BitBang protocol, which `OpenOCD <https://openocd.org>`_ implements.
